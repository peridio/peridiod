# Peridio Daemon

`peridiod` is a reference implementation of a Peridio Agent for Embedded Linux.

Peridio offers several ways to integrate peridiod into your build workflow via the following integration paths:

* Build system integration with [Yocto](build-tools/yocto) or [Buildroot](build-tools/buildroot)
* Leverage one of our pre compiled artifacts from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/peridio/peridiod/releases)
* Running in a container leveraging one of our [official container images](https://hub.docker.com/r/peridio/peridiod).
* Cross-Compiling as part of your custom build tools.
* As part of an existing [Elixir based application](https://github.com/peridio/peridio-nerves-example).
